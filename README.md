<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156149/192792402-4bb1e040-6f8c-49be-af90-fd35fd3a4c66.png" alt="CKEditor 5 used inside Strapi. Article form consisting of a title, excerpt text, and content">

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Starting from version 1.0.0, the CKEditor 5 custom field plugin is compatible with Strapi 5 and can‚Äôt be used in Strapi 4.4+. We decided to maintain integrations for both Strapi versions to ensure that you can still use our custom field before migrating to Strapi 5. Below is the [compatibility table](#compatibility) showing which plugin version should be used with your Strapi version.

This package provides a custom field for Strapi 5 that lets you use and configure CKEditor in no time.

Custom fields are supported since Strapi 4.4+ and offer powerful API to create highly customizable fields.

This is an official plugin, provided to you by the [CKEditor team](https://ckeditor.com) üëã

## <a id="features"></a>‚ú® Features

* **No code field customization:** customize each field for its specific usage scenario ‚Äì let it be short note, blog article, or a document.
* **Predefined editor presets:** a couple predefined editor presets (sets of CKEditor 5 plugins and their configuration) to choose from.
* **Custom max length validation:** Twitter-like length validation with visual indicators, based on the number of characters in the text, not the HTML string.
* **Dark mode support:** because you like it.
* **Media library integration:** inserting images directly from Strapi's media library.
* **More features coming soon:** upload adapter integration, more granular editor toolbar and plugins configuration, and more.

## <a id="installation"></a>üîß Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before installation, make sure that you own a **valid CKEditor 5 license key**. Start a [commitment-free trial](https://portal.ckeditor.com/checkout?plan=free) to get instant access to the license key. You can also refer to our [license key and activation guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs//ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/licensing/license-key-and-activation.html) to learn more.

Inside your Strapi app, add the package:

With `npm`:

```bash
npm install @ckeditor/strapi-plugin-ckeditor
```

With `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @ckeditor/strapi-plugin-ckeditor
```

Then, add the Content Security Policy configuration to allow loading CKEditor 5 from https://cdn.ckeditor.com origin and sending the editor usage information to https://proxy-event.ckeditor.com, by adding the rule to `config/middlewares.ts` in your Strapi project root:

```js
export default [
  // ...
  {
    name: 'strapi::security',
    config: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        useDefaults: true,
        directives: {
          'script-src': ['https://cdn.ckeditor.com'],
          'connect-src': ['https://proxy-event.ckeditor.com']
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
```

Finally run build:

```bash
npm run build
```

or:

```bash
yarn build
```

This section covers the way how to configure your environment if you want to contribute to this package.

### Setting up the environment

In order to start making changes in the plugin you first need to install Strapi infrastructure on top of the plugin repository.

```
npx create-strapi-app --quickstart strapi
cd strapi
```

By default Strapi does not create plugins folder so we need to create it.

```
mkdir -p src/plugins
```

Now we should clone this repository so we can work on it.

```
git clone git@github.com:ckeditor/strapi-plugin-ckeditor.git src/plugins/strapi-plugin-ckeditor
```

Let's add an entry inside `./package.json` file so, we won't need to use `yarn` inside plugin itself.

```
"workspaces": ["./src/plugins/strapi-plugin-ckeditor"]
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Now we need to register plugin so strapi can use it. In order to do that we need
to create (if not already created) `./config/plugins.js` file and add entry to it.

```
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  ckeditor: {
    enabled: true,
    resolve: "./src/plugins/strapi-plugin-ckeditor"
  },
});
```

Rebuild the project and start the server:

```
yarn build
yarn develop
```
